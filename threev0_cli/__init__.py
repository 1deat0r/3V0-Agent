    """Force UTF-8 stdout/stderr to prevent UnicodeEncodeError crashes.

    Several environments select a legacy, non-UTF-8 encoding for the standard
    streams:

    - Windows services and terminals default to cp1252.
    - Linux hosts with a latin-1 / C / POSIX locale (common on minimal Debian
      installs and Raspberry Pi) select latin-1 or ASCII.

    The CLI prints box-drawing characters (┌│├└─) and the ⚕ glyph in the setup
    wizard, doctor, and status banners. Encoding those under a non-UTF-8 codec
    raises an unhandled UnicodeEncodeError that crashes the command before it
    can even start — e.g. `3v0 setup` on a fresh Pi.

    This runs at import time so it protects every CLI subcommand, on any
    platform. It re-wraps stdout/stderr as UTF-8 when their encoding is not
    already UTF-8, preferring TextIOWrapper.reconfigure() so the existing
    stream object is fixed in place (cached `sys.stdout` references keep
    working) and falling back to reopening the file descriptor with
    closefd=False (the CPython-recommended safe variant).

    No-op when the streams are already UTF-8: a healthy UTF-8 system sees no
    stream change and no environment mutation.

    Note: this is intentionally the earliest, platform-agnostic guard.
    threev0_cli/stdio.py::configure_windows_stdio() runs later from the entry
    points and layers on the Windows-only extras (console code-page flip,
    EDITOR default, PATH augmentation); its stream reconfiguration is a
    harmless idempotent no-op once we have already repaired the streams here.
