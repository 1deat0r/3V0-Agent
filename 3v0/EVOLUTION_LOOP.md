# 3V0 — Own Evolution Loop (design)

This is the design for 3V0's second stone: **folding the profile's other
memory writers into the native store**, so the store at `3v0/data/memory.json`
becomes the single canonical origin and the Hermes profile (MEMORY.md /
USER.md) stays a derived projection.

It is the first step toward owning the whole evolution loop — replacing
"the Hermes background review fork + curator" as the totality of
self-improvement with a loop 3V0 itself controls. This document records the
**how**, verified against the actual runtime, before any code touched it.

## Current state (verified against the runtime checkout)

The runtime (`~/.hermes/hermes-agent/`) fires a background review fork after
every turn (`agent/background_review.py`). The fork:

- runs a forked `AIAgent` with a tool whitelist of `["memory", "skills"]`
  (gated on the profile's memory flags), `_persist_disabled=True`,
  `skip_memory=True`;
- sets `review_agent._memory_write_origin = "background_review"` and
  `_memory_write_context = "background_review"`;
- shares the parent's `MemoryStore` instance.

The fork saves memory by calling the **`memory` tool**, which writes
`$HERMES_HOME/memories/MEMORY.md` / `USER.md` directly via
`MemoryStore.add/replace/remove/apply_batch → save_to_disk` (`tools/memory_tool.py`).
That path **never touches the native store** — so the fork's writes land in
the profile, bypass the store's provenance/supersession, and only get pulled
into the store at the next wake as `source="profile-import"` facts (losing the
true origin and any supersession link).

The foreground has two memory paths today:

1. `memory` tool → profile (same profile-first write as the fork).
2. `3v0/scripts/record.py` → store-first (supersede, then re-export profile).

The seam we need already exists, in three pieces:

- **`post_tool_call` plugin hook** — `agent/tool_executor.py` dispatches
  `memory` inline and then fires `_emit_terminal_post_tool_call` →
  `model_tools._emit_post_tool_call_hook` → `hermes_cli.lifecycle.invoke_hook`,
  for *every* agent including the fork (the fork runs the same
  `run_conversation` → `execute_tool_calls_sequential`). Payload: `tool_name`,
  `args`, `result`, `task_id`, `session_id`, `tool_call_id`.
- **Write-origin ContextVar** — `tools/skill_provenance.get_current_write_origin()`
  returns `"background_review"` on the fork's thread and `"assistant_tool"` on
  the foreground's (bound per-thread in the turn prologue from
  `agent._memory_write_origin`). It is already read by `tools/write_approval.py`.
- **Store-first core** — `3v0/core/record.py` already does supersession; the
  store (`3v0/core/memory.py`) is append-only and never destroys.

## The design

A **profile plugin** bridges the `memory` tool onto the store. No edits to the
runtime checkout's core files — which matters, because the runtime is a
managed install (`hermes update` rewrites it) ~11 commits behind the body, and
the handoff's original sketches ("fork calls `record.py`", "writes
`data/memory.json` directly") would have meant widening the fork's whitelist or
editing `memory_tool.py`/`background_review.py` in place.

```
memory tool (foreground OR background fork)
   │  writes MEMORY.md / USER.md   (profile = derived view, as today)
   └─> post_tool_call hook fires (tool_name="memory", args, result)
        └─> native-store-bridge plugin (profile plugins/)
             │  reads get_current_write_origin() -> "background_review"|"assistant_tool"
             └─> subprocess: python3 3v0/scripts/ingest.py  (body repo)
                  │  reads {target, source, ops:[...]} on stdin
                  └─> under cross-process lock: replay ops into store
                       add      -> store.add(content, kind, source)
                       replace  -> supersede active fact w/ old_text (exactly one)
                                   else add
                       remove   -> retract active fact w/ old_text (exactly one)
```

### Why a plugin, not core surgery

- **Zero footprint elsewhere.** A plugin lives in
  `~/.hermes/profiles/3v0/plugins/` — other profiles and the default install
  are unaffected. This is the Footprint Ladder's "plugin" rung, the right one
  for agent-specific capability.
- **Survives `hermes update`.** Profile plugins are user data, not the managed
  checkout.
- **The fork needs no changes.** It already calls `memory` and already tags
  its writes with the origin we need; the plugin just observes and mirrors.

### Failure and degradation semantics

The bridge is **best-effort by construction**:

- If the store path is unreachable (body repo moved), the plugin silently
  skips — the `memory` tool behaves exactly as before.
- Every subprocess error is swallowed; `ingest.py` returns non-zero but the
  plugin ignores it.
- The wake-time `sync.py --write` (already in `handoff_check.sh`) remains the
  backstop reconciler: any write the bridge missed is still imported at wake
  as `source="profile-import"`, and any store/projection drift is healed.
- So the invariant degrades gracefully: **bridge up → exact provenance +
  supersession at write time; bridge down → plain profile-import at wake.**
  Never a broken memory write.

### Concurrency

The plugin introduces the first *concurrent* store writer (the fork runs in a
daemon thread, its `ingest.py` subprocess can race a foreground
`record.py`/`sync.py`). The store therefore gains a cross-process advisory
lock (`fcntl.flock` on a `.lock` sidecar), and every store writer
(`ingest.py`, `record.py`, `sync.py`) acquires it around load→mutate→save via
`MemoryStore.mutate()`.

### Supersession mapping

The Hermes `memory` tool matches `old_text` by substring against the profile
entries. The bridge replays that against the store's active facts:

- `add` → `store.add(content, kind, source)` if not already active (idempotent).
- `replace old→new` → supersede the **exactly one** active fact containing
  `old` (via `record`, which links the old fact to the new). Zero or multiple
  matches → plain `add` of `new` (never a guessed supersession link).
- `remove old` → `retract` the **exactly one** active fact containing `old`
  (marks it inactive with a `superseded_by="retracted"` sentinel; `history()`
  still recovers it as a terminal). Zero/multiple → skip.

Skipped ambiguous ops self-heal at wake sync: the store and profile are
reconciled idempotently, so the only cost of an ambiguous match is that
provenance is `profile-import` instead of exact. Correctness first, provenance
best-effort.

### Open questions (decided for stone 2)

1. **Curator.** The curator writes `skill_manage` (skills), not memory. Folding
   *it* into the store is a different axis — a skill store — and is **stone 2
   (below)**. The curator's own *auto-transitions* (active/stale/archived) are
   still out of scope: the skill store records `skill_manage` writes; the
   curator's state machine is a separate Hermes loop, not yet folded in.
2. **Profile still first-writer for memory.** The `memory` tool still writes
   MEMORY.md "first" and the bridge mirrors after. A future stone could make
   the *tool itself* store-first (the store writes, then projects to the
   profile) — but that requires editing the runtime checkout's core tool, which
   this design deliberately avoids.
3. **`identity`/`directive` kinds.** The bridge only maps `memory`/`user`
   (the tool's two targets). `identity`/`directive` stay store-only, written
   by `record.py` explicitly. Whether the fork should eventually write those
   is a later, separate question.

## Stone 2 — skill lineage (live)

The second stone closes the *skill* half of the evolution loop, mirroring
stone 1 exactly: a native store records 3V0's own skill evolution as a
versioned lineage, and the `native-store-bridge` plugin (same `post_tool_call`
hook) replays every successful `skill_manage` write into it.

### Verified seam (same as memory)

`skill_manage` is a *normal* core tool (not in `_AGENT_LOOP_TOOLS`), dispatched
through `model_tools.handle_function_call`, which fires `_emit_post_tool_call_hook`
for every agent including the fork. Its return value is
`json.dumps({"success": bool, ...})`, so the same `_result_ok` works. Provenance
uses the same `tools/skill_provenance.get_current_write_origin()` ContextVar —
it is already read by `skill_manager_tool.py` itself to tag `created_by`
(`"agent"` on the fork vs `null` for foreground/user-directed writes — which
the curator's status display labels "foreground-created").

### Design

```
skill_manage tool (foreground OR background fork OR curator's review agent)
   │  writes SKILL.md / supporting files (profile = operational system)
   └─> post_tool_call hook fires (tool_name="skill_manage", args, result)
        └─> native-store-bridge plugin (extended — same hook, second branch)
             └─> subprocess: python3 3v0/scripts/ingest_skills.py
                  └─> under cross-process lock: replay op into the skill store
                       create/edit/write_file/remove_file/patch -> new version,
                            superseding the active version of the same name
                       delete (no absorbed_into)  -> retract (tombstone)
                       delete (absorbed_into=X)   -> absorb (terminal, links X)
```

The skill store (`core/skills.py` + `core/skill_bridge.py`) is the *auditable
record*, not (yet) the operational mechanism: the profile's SKILL.md files stay
the system Hermes actually loads. Same posture as stone 1's memory store before
the wake sync — **the skill store records lineage with recoverable history; it
does not yet project back to SKILL.md.** The bridge is the skill store's only
writer; `seed_skills.py` establishes the baseline (agent-created skills only —
bundled/hub skills are 3V0's inherited catalog, not its evolution).

### Failure and degradation semantics

Best-effort by construction, exactly like memory: a missing body repo or a
failed subprocess is swallowed and the `skill_manage` write behaves as before.
There is **no wake-time skill reconciler yet** (unlike memory's `sync.py`), so
the bridge is the primary writer — a future stone can add a `sync_skills.py`
that reconciles store ↔ SKILL.md once the store becomes canonical.

### Open questions (decide before stone 3)

1. **Canonicality.** When (if ever) should the skill store drive SKILL.md (a
   projection, like memory's MEMORY.md)? Doing so means the store must hold
   full skill content for every version — it already does for create/edit, but
   `patch` records only the old→new note, not the resulting full file.
2. **Curator auto-transitions.** The curator's state machine (active/stale/
   archived via `.usage.json` + `.curator_state`) is still Hermes-owned. Folding
   it into the store means representing skill *state* as versions, not just
   `skill_manage` writes.
3. **Bundled skills.** The store excludes bundled/hub skills by design. If 3V0
   ever wants a full catalog lineage, that's a separate seed.
